 *
 * A hash is *scope-prefixed* (`natural:`, `file:`, `gmail:`, …) so that two
 * different sources that happen to share a value (e.g. a file-byte hash
 * collides with an order number — astronomically unlikely but trivially
 * dodged here) can never produce the same Transaction.sourceHash.
 *
 * If a path has no deterministic identity (manual UI entry), the row is
 * stored with `sourceHash = NULL` and the partial unique index (see the
 * phase-4.5 migration) exempts it from dedup — we simply can't tell a
 * user-retry from a genuine second trade on manual entry.
