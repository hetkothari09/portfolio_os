/**
 * Family / HOF access-control core.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "who can see what and write what" across
 * the app. Every service that does cross-user reads (dashboard,
 * analytics, portfolio list, non-AC entity lists) resolves an
 * `EffectiveScope` via `getEffectiveScope` and consults it — nothing
 * else in the codebase should know about `FamilyMember` rows directly.
 *
 * Why this abstraction: the current implementation (Phase 5c) uses
 * service-layer fan-out with `runAsUser` per member to satisfy the
 * existing single-user RLS policies. When we migrate to Approach 2
 * (RLS with a delegation function), only this module and the fan-out
 * loops in dashboard/analytics change — every downstream caller keeps
 * using the same `EffectiveScope` shape.
 *
 * Rules (revised post-feedback):
 *   - Personal view (no familyId) → caller sees own data only.
 *   - Family view (familyId set)  → the "family scope" is the UNION of
 *     every active member's personal data + every family-shared entity.
 *       - OWNER      → sees the whole union; no visibility filter.
 *       - CONTRIBUTOR → sees the whole union filtered by their
 *                       `visibleAssetClasses` / `visibleCategories`
 *                       (empty = no restriction = allow all). Restricted
 *                       classes render blank on the member's screens.
 *                       Can add own transactions; can write to family
 *                       portfolios; cannot mutate peer personal data.
 *       - VIEWER     → same visibility as CONTRIBUTOR but read-only.
 *
 * The earlier "Rule A" (peers never see each other's personal data) was
 * reversed after real-world testing showed family members expect to see
 * the household's whole picture. Restrictions are now a filter on the
 * aggregated family view, not a firewall against peer personal data.
 * Personal-view semantics unchanged — a solo user's personal login
 * still shows only their own data.
