/**
 * Family / HOF access-control core.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "who can see what and write what" across
 * the app. Every service that does cross-user reads (dashboard,
 * analytics, portfolio list, non-AC entity lists) resolves an
 * `EffectiveScope` via `getEffectiveScope` and consults it — nothing
 * else in the codebase should know about `FamilyMember` rows directly.
 *
 * Why this abstraction: the current implementation (Phase 5c) uses
 * service-layer fan-out with `runAsUser` per member to satisfy the
 * existing single-user RLS policies. When we migrate to Approach 2
 * (RLS with a delegation function), only this module and the fan-out
 * loops in dashboard/analytics change — every downstream caller keeps
 * using the same `EffectiveScope` shape.
 *
 * Rules (locked in Phase 3):
 *   - OWNER      → sees every active member's personal assets + all
 *                  family-shared assets; no visibility filter applies.
 *                  Can write to any member's family portfolios.
 *   - CONTRIBUTOR → sees own personal + family-shared assets. Filtered
 *                  by their `visibleAssetClasses` / `visibleCategories`.
 *                  Can write to family portfolios of families they
 *                  belong to. Cannot see peers' personal data.
 *   - VIEWER     → same visibility as CONTRIBUTOR. Read-only on family
 *                  portfolios; can still write to own personal
 *                  portfolios.
 * Rule A: CONTRIBUTOR/VIEWER never see another member's personal data.
 * To grant cross-member visibility → promote to OWNER.
