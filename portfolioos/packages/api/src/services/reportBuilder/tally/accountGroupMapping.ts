/**
 * Exact-code overrides for this app's hardcoded `DEFAULT_COA`
 * (accounting.service.ts:8-44) — the ~27 accounts every user gets via
 * `ensureDefaultAccounts`. Checked first because it's precise; falls
 * through to name-substring heuristics, then a per-AccountType default,
 * for any user-created custom account that doesn't match one of these
 * codes.
 *
 * Rationale per row:
 * - 1000 Assets / 1100 Investments are this app's own bucket headers
 *   (no reserved Tally equivalent for a bare "Assets" group) — bucket
 *   rows still get exported as real ledgers (matching how
 *   buildChartOfAccountsLayout treats them), so they need *some* mapping;
 *   default to the closest reserved group for their contents.
 * - 1001 Bank Accounts / 1002 Cash in Hand map 1:1 to Tally's own
 *   reserved sub-groups of the same purpose.
 * - 1101/1102/1104/1105 (equity/MF/bonds/gold holdings) → "Investments":
 *   Tally's reserved "Investments" primary group is exactly for
 *   non-trade holdings like these.
 * - 1103 Fixed Deposits → "Deposits (Asset)": a more precise reserved
 *   sub-group than generic Investments for bank/post-office deposits.
 * - 2001 Loans & Borrowings → "Loans (Liability)": kept at the primary-
 *   group level rather than guessing Secured vs Unsecured, since this app
 *   doesn't track that distinction and guessing wrong misclassifies debt.
 * - 3002 Retained Earnings → "Reserves & Surplus": Tally's precise
 *   reserved sub-group for accumulated profit/loss carry-forward.
 * - 4xxx (all income) → "Indirect Incomes": this app models personal
 *   investment accounting, not a trading business — Tally's "Direct
 *   Income" is for income from the core traded goods of a business,
 *   which doesn't apply here, so every income account (dividend,
 *   interest, capital gains, rental, other) is non-operating/"Indirect".
 * - 5002 STT & Transaction Tax → "Duties & Taxes": exact reserved-group
 *   fit for a statutory tax line.
 * - 5xxx (remaining expenses) → "Indirect Expenses": mirrors the income
 *   reasoning above — none of these are cost-of-goods for a trade.
